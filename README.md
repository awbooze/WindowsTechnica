# WindowsTechnica
This is a port of [Android Technica](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica) to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). I always thought that UWP had a lot of potential, so I wanted to get to know it well, similarly to how I was getting to know Android, so I started developing this. I expect that Windows Technica will track a ways behind Android Technica in features, as I will have to port them over, but will eventually get to feature parity.

## Features
* Access to all Ars Technica articles through their excellent website
* Native dark and light themes - change between them in settings, or use your default Windows theme

## Feature Roadmap
* RSS Notifications
