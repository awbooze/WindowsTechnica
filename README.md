This is a port of [Android Technica](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica) to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Ever since Windows 10 was released, I have been enamored with the "write once, run anywhere" promise of UWP. By the time I was able to get a feel for developing a UWP application, I was also developing Android Technica, so I began to port it over because I knew I would use it often on both Windows and Android. Overall, I hope this project will help me learn C# and the Universal Windows Platform, as well as lead to a polished program that I will use often.

## Features
* Access to all Ars Technica articles through their excellent website
* Native dark and light themes - change between them in settings, or use your default Windows theme
* Notifications for Ars Technica articles based on Ars' topical RSS feeds
    * Get toast notifications for some articles and live tile notifications for others
    * Add a badge notification to your lock screen to see how many toast notifications you've missed
    * Click or tap a toast notification to go directly to the article or view comments

### Feature Roadmap
I expect that Windows Technica will track a bit behind Android Technica in features, as I will have to research how to implement each feature, but will eventually reach feature parity.

* General polish and preparation for the 1.0 release
